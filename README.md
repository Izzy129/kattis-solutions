## Kattis Solutions

This is a repository containing my solutions for [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com) problems.

## Accessing Problems
To access a problem, navigate to https://open.kattis.com/problems/problem , replacing problem in the URL with the solution program name.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
